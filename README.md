# -SMART-PAY-
I recently completed a Scaler course focused on the low level design of payment methods.

The course gave me a clear and practical understanding of how real payment systems like SmartPay are built, through real case studies such as PhonePe with Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, and platforms like Amazon and Flipkart.

After this course, I worked on a practical project where we designed a smart payment application called JawalPay (جوال باي).

Key features of my project:
• Wallet to wallet money transfer
• Bank to wallet transactions
• Transaction history tracking
• Refund transaction system
• Smart and user friendly payment flow

This experience helped me apply low level design concepts into a real system.

I will also share the link to my notes in this post.
Thankful to Scaler for this valuable learning experience.
